              I love RimWorld and was amazed at how much amazing fan-made art I came across. But it was all scattered about in various reddit posts,
              with some great but old posts not getting enough attention.
              So I decided to create a website gather all the art in one place, hence analogy of an art museum. 
              The art on the page is what I have selected after scraping most of the art that was posted on reddit. 
              I have selected for art that depict persons or situation from RimWorld without text or multiple panels. That means 
              no memes and no comics. I may make a separate page with RimWorld themed comics strips in the future.
            </p>
              I do not take credit for any of the art on this page and link to the original posts of the authors.
              I hope the that having their art displayed here will raise their profile.
